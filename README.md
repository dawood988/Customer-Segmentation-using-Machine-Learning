# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning
# 🛍️ Project Overview
A retailer has hired me to create customer segments (clusters) using a data-driven approach. By analyzing past transaction-level purchase data, I aim to identify distinct customer groups based on both aggregate sales patterns and specific items purchased.

This project leverages Unsupervised Learning techniques, specifically K-Means Clustering, to uncover meaningful customer segments.

# 📂 Dataset
The input dataset is available in the Files folder. It contains historical transaction data, which is analyzed to extract customer insights.

# 📑 Methodology
The project follows these steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding the data, handling missing values, and visualizing patterns.

Feature Engineering – Extracting relevant features from transactional data.

Scaling & Preprocessing – Standardizing data to improve clustering accuracy.

Applying K-Means Clustering – Identifying distinct customer segments.

Evaluation & Visualization – Analyzing segment characteristics using visualizations.

# 🖥️ Code & Implementation

The entire implementation, from data analysis to clustering, is available in the Jupyter Notebook.

# Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for K-Means Clustering)

# 📊 Results & Insights
The final model successfully segments customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. These insights can help the retailer optimize marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance business decision-making.
